# notadm<br>

(coming soon) I want to do a bit more testing before adding the scripts.				<br>

Notadm (not a dosplay manager) is a few scripts that overwrite agetty's /etc/issue.			<br>
Allows you to add whatever you'd want above your tty login prompt. 					<br>
This example uses archey3 and adds some info below it.							<br>
